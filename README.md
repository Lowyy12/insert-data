# insert-data
In this project I have created an interface that passes the information to a csv file, which processes it to create SQL statements to end up populating a table called Products

## What we will have to modify would be the SQL session

```bash
python3 apli.py
python3 procesar_datos.py
sqlplus user/password @productos.sql
```
